# Notes from ICSE 2018

## Sunday, May 27 (Cooperative & Human Aspects of Software Engineering)

### Psychological Safety and Norm Clarity in Software Engineering Teams

* What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
* Impact, Meaning, Structure & Clarity, Dependability, Psychological Safety
* Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.
* Team norm clarity:  In a team with high norm clarity, it is clear what is,and what is not, acceptable behavior.
* Team norm clarity seems to be a slightly better predictor of job satisfaction, etc., than psychological safety.
* How can you foster psychological safety and norm clarity in software engineering teams?

### The Structure of Software Design Discussions

* Design Erosion:  Information on the design of a project slowly deteriorates over time.
* Can we use discussions to recover design information that's been lost?
* How does design information occur in written discussion?  (Where?)
* How are elements of design information related in a written discussion?  (How?)
* Structure of a discussion is nonlinear.
* Candidates (potential solutions) are often hard to distinguish from questions.

### Research Cooperation and Communication in Continuous Software Engineering

* Continuous Software Engineering:  Releasing ASAP; two weeks = a year.
* Challenges:  Tooling & architecting, quality, and business & user interaction.
* Automate the build, test, deploy pipeline.
* Challenges:  Design for testability & deployability.
* Your test automation is only as good as your test suite.
* How can we make the business agile enough to mesh with the agile development?
  * Continuous planning and budgeting.

### Some reasons why actual cross-fertilization in cross-functional teams is difficult

* Cross-functional:  The team has all the expertise it needs without any outside help.
* Cross-fertilization:  Spreading knowledge from different domains and people across the team.
* What is motivating or demotivating team members to work in a cross-functional manner?
* Inclination to interact  affected by:
  * Perception of inefficiency
  * Desire to learn
  * Sense of domain responsibility:  to keep the work and your personal knowledge in your own domain in proper shape.
  * Issues with career progression
  * Domain distance:  if you're required to do something further away from your area of expertise.
  * Wrong level of detail
  * Loss of focus
* Cognitave distance&mdash;connects to domain distance and level of detail.  Preknowledge of individuals likely a factor.  Personal motivation and personality also.
* Zone approximate development?

### What would a science of software engineering look like?

Jim Herbsleb @ Institute for Software Research @ Carnegie Mellon
* Does SE research have impact?
  * No one seems confident.
  * Computer science is the scientific underpinning of SE, but SE is not CS.
* Does science create impact?
  * Trial and error is a slow way to work toward an understanding.
  * Science may not have immediate application.
  * "Theory-oriented software engineering"; "A systematic review of theory use in software engineering experiements"
* What sort of science?
  * Human science of software engineering.
  * Problem:  people finding the right experts at a remote site.  Solution:  expertise browser.
  * Transactive memory systems (TMS).
  * Socio-technical coordination:  think of it as a constraint satisfaction problem over engineering design decisions.
* Barriers to human science of SE:
  * The universal principle of interdisciplinary contempt.
  * The Dilbert Pointy Haired Boss Principle:  everything I don't understand is simple.
  * Intellectual worth is evaluated on a single dimension:  from math to BS.
  * Not all statistical models are just about prediction.
  * Border defense:  Is that *really* CS?
  * Necessity to argue for practical application of each result.
