## Sunday, May 27 (Cooperative & Human Aspects of Software Engineering)

### Psychological Safety and Norm Clarity in Software Engineering Teams

* What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
* Impact, Meaning, Structure & Clarity, Dependability, Psychological Safety
* Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking.
* Team norm clarity:  In a team with high norm clarity, it is clear what is,and what is not, acceptable behavior.
* Team norm clarity seems to be a slightly better predictor of job satisfaction, etc., than psychological safety.
* How can you foster psychological safety and norm clarity in software engineering teams?

### The Structure of Software Design Discussions

* Design Erosion:  Information on the design of a project slowly deteriorates over time.
* Can we use discussions to recover design information that's been lost?
* How does design information occur in written discussion?  (Where?)
* How are elements of design information related in a written discussion?  (How?)
* Structure of a discussion is nonlinear.
* Candidates (potential solutions) are often hard to distinguish from questions.

### Research Cooperation and Communication in Continuous Software Engineering

* Continuous Software Engineering:  Releasing ASAP; two weeks = a year.
* Challenges:  Tooling & architecting, quality, and business & user interaction.
* Automate the build, test, deploy pipeline.
* Challenges:  Design for testability & deployability.
* Your test automation is only as good as your test suite.
* How can we make the business agile enough to mesh with the agile development?
  * Continuous planning and budgeting.
